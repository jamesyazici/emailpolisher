# ðŸš€ Deployment Options for Email Polisher

## Option 1: Free Hosting on Railway

Railway offers free hosting that's perfect for this application:

### Steps:
1. **Create Railway Account**: Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up
2. **Connect GitHub**: Link your GitHub account
3. **Deploy from GitHub**:
   - Create a new project
   - Connect this repository
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js app
4. **Environment Variables**: Set `NODE_ENV=production` if you want to use real LLM APIs
5. **Deploy**: Railway will build and deploy automatically

### Configuration:
Create a `railway.json` file:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "healthcheckPath": "/healthz"
  }
}
```

## Option 2: Free Hosting on Render

Render also offers free hosting:

### Steps:
1. **Create Render Account**: Visit [render.com](https://render.com)
2. **New Web Service**: Connect your GitHub repo
3. **Settings**:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Environment**: Node
4. **Deploy**: Render will build and deploy

## Option 3: Free Hosting on Vercel

Vercel is great for static hosting but needs slight modification:

### Steps:
1. **Create Vercel Account**: Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. **Import Project**: Connect your GitHub repo
3. **Configure**: Vercel will detect it as a Node.js project
4. **Deploy**: Automatic deployment on every push

## Option 4: Free Hosting on Netlify

For static hosting, we'd need to create a separate frontend:

### Configuration needed:
Create a `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200
```

## Option 5: Heroku (Free tier discontinued)

Heroku used to be the go-to option but they discontinued their free tier.

## Recommended: Railway

Railway is the easiest option because:
- âœ… Free tier available
- âœ… Automatic builds from GitHub
- âœ… Easy custom domain setup
- âœ… Built-in monitoring
- âœ… No configuration needed

## Custom Domain Setup

Once deployed on any platform:
1. **Purchase Domain**: Use Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains
2. **Add CNAME Record**: Point your domain to the hosting platform
3. **Configure SSL**: Most platforms provide free SSL certificates

Example domains:
- `emailpolisher.com`
- `professionalemail.app`
- `emailgenerator.ai`

## Environment Variables for Production

If you want to use real AI models:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
LLM_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4
PORT=3000
```

## Traffic and Scaling

Free tiers usually include:
- **Railway**: 500 hours/month
- **Render**: 750 hours/month
- **Vercel**: Unlimited for hobby projects

For higher traffic, upgrade to paid plans starting at $5-10/month.
